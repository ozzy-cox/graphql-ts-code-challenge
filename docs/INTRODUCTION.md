# Coding Challenge

## Problem

To strengthen communication and connection within the team after switching to remote work, we want to create an internal platform where everyone feels free to share anything on their minds anonymously.

On this platform, anyone can share a post that does not exceed 280 characters. And anyone who wishes can send a reaction to it or add a comment on the condition that it does not exceed 280 characters.

The diagram of the application is primarily as follows:

## MVP Scope

The MVP scope of the application will be as given below:

- The application does not include any user information, therefore it does not contain any authentication or authorization either.
- Posts are shared on the application.
- Reactions can be sent to the shared posts.
- Comments can be made on the shared posts.
- Reactions can be sent to the added comments.
- Comments can be made on the added comments.


## Scenarios

You can find the user stories written in the [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) format within the `stories` folder.
